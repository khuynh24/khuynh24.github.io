My team was tasked with designing and implementing a playable game in C, using the supplied griddisplay.h header.
The game was to be entirely keyboard-driven using the SSH terminal. We decided to build an “endless runner” game with obstacles 
to avoid by ducking or jumping. To make the game challenging, we decided to have obstacles of various heights, a pit that the 
character can fall into, and an object that the character must duck under. To make the game even more entertaining, we decided 
to make the game appear animated, with the character running, a background object moving by to give the illusion of movement, 
and a new image when the character falls into a pit or hits an object.
