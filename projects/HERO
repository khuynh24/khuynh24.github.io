## Project H.E.R.O


For our English 100 class, we were given a special group project to create a hypothetical organization aimed at improving some
aspect of life on Oahu. The project required us to research a problem here in the islands along with possible solutions to 
address this issue. We had to use our collaborative research to display the components of our organization in the form of a 
website. The issue my team and I decided to address was the lack of helmet safety in Oahu. We decided that our approach to 
counteract the problem is to create an organization that promotes helmet safety awareness. 

One of the aspects I contributed towards was the solution. I developed a solution with my classmates to design a way to spread 
the awareness of helmet safety by holding functions at community rec-centers and pass out free helmets along with education 
flyers about head gear protection. We also developed a plan where local companies and donors would fund the movement we were 
hypothetical making. Another one of my roles is to format the website. Although I used a simple "build your own website with a 
template", it definitely challenging to juggle creating a research paper and learning the functions of developing the website. 
Luckily, I was able to figure out how to format the website in the way our organization wanted it to be. To liven up the 
website, I also found a way to add a playlist to the site. 

Project Hero was my first group project in college and for the most part, all my group members were really engaged in this 
project. I think that we did an amazing job joining heads together to come up with creative solutions and ideas to develop 
other aspects of our organization. What I learned from this group project is how difficult it is for everyone to agree on 
one single idea. I also learned how exhausting it is to build an organization and the commitment that goes into it. Some 
aspects I discovered from this project is the importance of cooperation and responsibility.
Overall, I learned a lot from my first group project.
