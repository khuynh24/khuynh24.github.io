Frameworks with semantic UI will make your life a lot easier. Actually, investing any time in to learning a framework will be 
essentially worth it.  That is, having gained the ability will allow you to be able to build professional pleasing webpages in 
a significantly shorter amount of time rather than using classic ole HTML and CSS. 

In my own experience, after my first week learning Semantic UI. I realize how simple and convenient it is to create boarders 
and menus with just a few lines of codes. Although it was frustrating trying to figure out how the heck to create the code. 
I would say it was not too bad. Being able to apply some features provided by semantic UI and having access to look up example 
codes, brings me back to the point of how amazing it will make your life and the webpages you develop. I am a strong believer 
that frameworks are a helpful skill for any developer since you are able to focus more on the important stuff and forget about 
the little things.

Overall, the walls which were once built from using classic ole HTML and CSS gets broken down with UI frameworks. 
Spending less time inspecting every line of code is behind us, that is if you decide to pick up on gaining the skills of 
utilizing frameworks. The possibilities of building creative and beautiful web applications are infinite. Lines get shorter. 
Web pages are developed. Life gets better.
