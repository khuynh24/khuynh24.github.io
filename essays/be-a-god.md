## Be A God

Growing up, I never had an interest in anything and allows had a problem of deciding what I wanted to do in the future. For years throughout, high school I would constantly look up different career options and frequently came across careers in Computer Science. Ironically, I befriended someone that majored in CS and eventually he persuaded me to consider the career pathway. I begin doing more research on what it takes to be an CS major and what really lured me into the major were the key words, "problem solving", "creating", and "working in teams".

## You Never Know Unless You Try

If there is one thing I love more than pizza, it would be building and finding solutions to fix a problem. Therefore, I knew that I had to give programming a try. After enrolling in my first ICS class and building my first program, I was instantly amazed in what I can build through the use of computers. The world is advancing through the use of applications and I want to be a part of the growth. 

## Dream

As I grow more knowledgeable, I hope to master the material and become the next shifu of software development or web design. My dream is to be a part of a startup company that I am passionate about and develop software to help grow the company.
