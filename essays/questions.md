There is always a time in our lives when we all experience a road block and looked around seeking for help, and in response
we don't get the answer were looking for. Well I am sorry to say that the reason you didn't get an effective answer is not
the source's fault, it's you. Have you ever heard of the saying "Dumb questions get dumb answers"? Well, in my experience in retail, I can raise my hand that the statement is 100% true.

According to Eric Raymond in "How to ask questions the smart way", he goes into detail on how to avoid looking stupid and teaches us well basically how to ask questions the smart way. I suggest you read the article and come back unless you want to be stuck in a never ending while loop of receiving pitiful solutions.

Now that you've return a wiser human being, I found some questions on stack overflow to help you understand how to produce a smart question.
